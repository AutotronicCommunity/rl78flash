About
=====

This is PC software to program RL78 microcontrollers via serial bootloader.
This version can not set any security mode. Only S-record image files are
accepted as input files. RL78/G10 parts can programmed only in 1-wire mode,
other RL78 parts support both 1-wire and 2-wire modes. Reset signal is
controlled by DTR or RTS signal.

Download
========

Binary version for Windows can be downloader from
https://github.com/msalau/rl78flash/releases

Linux users are encouraged to build rl78flash by himself.

Usage examples
==============

$ rl78flash -viva /dev/ttyUSB0 R5F100SL.mot
$ rl78g10flash -vvwcr /dev/ttyUSB0 R5F10Y16.mot 2k

See also output from 
$ rl78flash -h
and
$ rl78g10flash -h

Rewrite MCU with RESET pin acting as GPIO
-----------------------------------------

If RESET pin of MCU is acting as GPIO it is no longer possible to enter
bootloader mode without additional user actions. To enter bootloader
mode it nessesary to power up MCU with RESET pin tied to ground.

Procedute to rewrite such microcontrollers:
1. power down MCU
2. start rl78flash tool with -d argument
  $ rl78flash -diva /dev/ttyUSB0 firmware.mot
3. wait till message "Turn MCU's power on and press any key..."
4. power up MCU
5. press any key
6. that's all.

This procedure is valid for rl78g10flash too.
